      <description>The advent of 6G communications technology presents a unique opportunity to introduce innovative solutions, technologies, and methodologies aimed at alleviating the economic and ecological pressures of the industry. The EU-funded ORIGAMI project seeks to capitalise on this opportunity by revolutionising mobile network architecture and advancing it towards global standardisation, enhanced sustainability, accessibility, and affordability. The project aims to address eight key barriers essential to the future of 6G by introducing a series of network intelligent (NI) solutions powered by three pivotal architectural innovations: global service-based architecture, compute continuum layer, and zero-trust exposure layer. These innovations are poised to stimulate further advancements and development within the industry. Ultimately, the project will demonstrate its solutions in eight locations.</description>

      <description>While artificial intelligence (AI) models are commonly regarded as the cornerstone of network intelligence (NI) design, AI is not the most suitable tool for every NI task. The EU-funded DAEMON project will create a pragmatic approach to NI design. It will carry out a systematic analysis of which NI tasks are appropriately solved with AI models, providing a solid set of guidelines for the use of machine learning in network functions. Building on the insights of this analysis, DAEMON will design NI algorithms to drive a core set of Beyond-5G (B5G) network functionalities. The NI-assisted functionalities will be finally deployed into an original end-to-end NI-native architecture for B5G that enables their full coordination.</description>

      <description>The vision of the 5Growth project is to empower verticals industries such as Industry 4.0, Transportation, and Energy with an AI-driven Automated and Sharable 5G End-to-End Solution that will allow these industries to achieve simultaneously their respective key performance targets. Towards this vision, 5Growth will automate the process for supporting diverse industry verticals through (i) a vertical portal in charge of interfacing verticals with the 5G End-to-End platforms, receiving their service requests and building the respective network slices on top, (ii) closed-loop automation and SLA control for vertical services lifecycle management and (iii) AI-driven end-to-end network solutions to jointly optimize Access, Transport, Core and Cloud, Edge and Fog resources, across multiple technologies and domains.</description>

      <description>FLAVIA is a project funded by the European Commission under FP7 Call 5, Objective 1.1: The Network of the Future. FLAVIA fosters a paradigm shift towards the Future Wireless Internet: from pre-designed link services to programmable link processors. The key concept is to expose flexible programmable interfaces enabling service customization and performance optimization through software-based exploitation of low-level operations and control primitives, e.g., transmission timing, frame customization and processing, spectrum and channel management, power control, etc.</description>

      <description>CARMEN (CARrier grade MEsh Networks) is funded by the European Commission under the ICT theme ICT-2007.1.1 - The network of the future. CARMEN will study and specify a wireless mesh network supporting carrier grade triple-play services for mobile/fixed network operators. Future operator networks will be comprised of a common core network and several access networks, and the CARMEN access network will complement other access technologies by providing a low cost and fast deployment mesh network access technology. The project proposes the integration of heterogeneous wireless technologies in a multi-hop fashion to provide scalable and efficient ubiquitous quad-play carrier services.</description>
