abstract = "Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling (DOS) exploits multiuser diversity in wireless networks without the requirement of a central scheduler. With DOS, users take their own scheduling decisions based on a local observation of the channel to maximize performance. While DOS has been used in the past to optimize throughput-related figures, in this paper we use DOS to optimize the energy performance of the network. We first derive the optimal configuration for the homogeneous scenario, where all devices share the same power consumption behavior, and then propose a heuristic to address the heterogeneous scenario, where devices have different power consumption figures. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approaches."
