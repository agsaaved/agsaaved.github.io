# Biography
Andres Garcia-Saavedra is a Senior Researcher at NEC Laboratories Europe, Germany. His research interests lie in the application of fundamental mathematics to real-life computer communications systems, both wired and (specially) wireless; including resource allocation problems, energy efficiency, network coding, low-delay communications and Tactile Internet applications (haptic VR/AR). He particularly enjoys building real prototypes and carrying out experimental performance evaluations of protocols and communication systems.
