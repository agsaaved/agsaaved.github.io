abstract = "The 802.11e standard enables user configuration of several MAC parameters, making WLANs vulnerable to users that selfishly configure these parameters to gain throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm to thwart such selfish behavior. The key idea of the algorithm is for stations to react, upon detecting a misbehavior, by using a more aggressive configuration that penalizes the misbehaving station. We show that the proposed algorithm guarantees global stability while providing good response times. By conducting an analysis of the effectiveness of the algorithm against selfish behaviors, we also show that a misbehaving station cannot obtain any gain by deviating from the algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm optimizes throughput performance while discouraging selfish behavior. We also present an experimental prototype of the proposed algorithm demonstrating that it can be implemented on commodity hardware."
